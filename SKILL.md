# Higher Pleasures Assessment

Apply Mill's qualitative hedonism to evaluate options, outcomes, or experiences—distinguishing the higher pleasures that engage our distinctively human faculties from the lower pleasures of mere bodily gratification.

---

## When to Use

- Comparing alternatives to determine which is genuinely more valuable
- User asks "Is this worth pursuing?" or "Which option is better?"
- Someone argues that popularity proves value
- Defending education, culture, or character development
- Evaluating lifestyle choices or priorities
- Distinguishing genuine well-being from mere satisfaction

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| options | Yes | The pleasures, experiences, or outcomes being compared |
| context | No | The situation or decision in which the comparison matters |
| common_view | No | A popular opinion about value that may need examination |

## Mill's Qualitative Hedonism

"It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone."

"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question."

"Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure."

---

## The Framework (5 Steps)

**Step 1: Identify the Pleasures Being Compared**

Clarify what experiences or outcomes are under evaluation:
- What are the specific pleasures involved?
- Are we comparing a single higher pleasure against a greater quantity of lower pleasures?
- Are we comparing two pleasures of different kinds?

**Step 2: Classify the Pleasures**

Determine whether each pleasure engages:

**Higher Faculties (Higher Pleasures):**
- Intellectual engagement (learning, reasoning, discovery)
- Moral satisfaction (doing right, helping others, integrity)
- Aesthetic appreciation (beauty, art, nature)
- Creative expression (making, building, inventing)
- Meaningful relationships (love, friendship, community)
- Character development (growth, self-improvement, virtue)

**Lower Faculties (Lower Pleasures):**
- Bodily sensations (food, drink, comfort, rest)
- Physical gratification (sensory pleasure, bodily ease)
- Simple amusements (passive entertainment, distraction)

*Note:* Lower pleasures are not bad—they are genuine goods. The question is whether they should be traded for higher pleasures.

**Step 3: Consult the Competent Judges**

Mill's test: ask those who have experienced both:

- Of those who know both alternatives well, which do they prefer?
- Do they prefer it even when accompanied by some discomfort?
- Would they trade it for any quantity of the alternative?

"A person who has experienced both gives a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it."

Those who prefer lower pleasures typically know only their own side of the question—they have not truly experienced the higher alternative.

**Step 4: Consider the Full Picture**

Higher pleasures often involve:
- Greater initial effort to access (education, training, cultivation)
- Less intensity in the moment but greater satisfaction over time
- Vulnerability to suffering (those who appreciate beauty also suffer more from ugliness)
- Development of capacities that enable further development

This is why competent judges are necessary—those who haven't done the work to access higher pleasures cannot fairly evaluate them.

**Step 5: Render Assessment**

Based on the analysis, determine:
- Which pleasure is qualitatively higher?
- What trade-offs, if any, are acceptable?
- What does this imply for the decision or evaluation at hand?

## Higher Pleasures Assessment

### The Options Under Evaluation
[Describe the pleasures, experiences, or outcomes being compared]

### Classification

| Option | Faculties Engaged | Classification |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| [Option A] | [What capacities it exercises] | [Higher/Lower] |
| [Option B] | [What capacities it exercises] | [Higher/Lower] |

### The Competent Judges Test

**Those who have experienced both would prefer:**
[Analysis of what those with experience of both alternatives actually choose]

**Why those who prefer the lower option may not be competent judges:**
[If applicable—limited experience, never cultivated the capacity, etc.]

### Qualitative Assessment

**[Option] is qualitatively superior because:**
- [Reason 1 - what faculties it engages]
- [Reason 2 - what satisfactions it provides]
- [Reason 3 - what development it enables]

**The trade-off:**
[Acknowledgment of what is given up, but why the higher pleasure is worth it]

### The Verdict

[Clear statement of which option is more valuable and why]

**The Principle Applied:**
"It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."
```

## Higher vs. Lower Pleasures: Examples

| Higher Pleasures | Lower Pleasures |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Reading philosophy | Scrolling social media |
| Creating art | Consuming fast food |
| Deep conversation | Small talk |
| Mastering a skill | Passive entertainment |
| Moral action | Physical comfort |
| Intellectual discovery | Sensory indulgence |
| Appreciation of beauty | Mere amusement |

## Common Objections Addressed

**"This is elitist!"**
Mill's view is not that some people are better than others, but that some pleasures are better than others—and anyone can access higher pleasures through education and effort. The elitism is in *denying* people access to higher pleasures, not in recognizing their value.

**"Popularity should determine value."**
If we asked only those who have experienced push-pin and not poetry, push-pin would win. But the judgment of those who know only one side is unreliable. Competent judges—those who know both—consistently prefer higher pleasures.

**"Lower pleasures are perfectly fine."**
They are! Mill does not condemn lower pleasures. He simply notes that when forced to choose, and when one knows both, the higher pleasure is preferred. A life rich in higher pleasures is better than a life containing only lower ones.

**"But I prefer Netflix to Nietzsche!"**
Have you cultivated the capacity to appreciate Nietzsche? Have you given both a fair trial? Those who have typically prefer the intellectual engagement—though they also enjoy relaxation in its place.

## Constraints

- Do not dismiss lower pleasures as worthless—they are genuine goods
- Remember that accessing higher pleasures often requires cultivation
- Respect that people at different stages have different capacities
- Avoid confusing unfamiliarity with genuine preference
- Consider that a good life contains both higher and lower pleasures in balance

## Example

**Input:** "My teenager wants to drop out of college to become a social media influencer. They say they'd make more money and be happier. How should I think about this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Higher Pleasures Assessment

### The Options Under Evaluation
- **Option A:** Completing a college education
- **Option B:** Pursuing a career as a social media influencer

### Classification

| Option | Faculties Engaged | Classification |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| College education | Intellectual development, character formation, exposure to ideas, critical thinking, systematic knowledge | Higher |
| Influencer career | Entertainment creation, audience attention, financial reward, fame | Mixed (some creative elements, but primarily lower) |

### The Competent Judges Test

**Those who have experienced both would prefer:**

Consider those who completed higher education and later became content creators versus those who skipped education entirely. The former group typically reports that their education enriched their creative work, gave them perspective, and provided resources they continue to draw upon. They rarely wish they had skipped it.

Meanwhile, many who achieved early success as influencers later express regret at opportunities missed, find their fame hollow, or discover that the "happiness" of likes and followers does not sustain them.

**Why those who prefer the lower option may not be competent judges:**

Your teenager, at this moment, has not experienced the pleasures that education makes possible. They know the dopamine hit of social media engagement; they do not yet know the satisfaction of intellectual mastery, of understanding how the world works, of having ideas that no algorithm provided. They know only their own side of the question.

### Qualitative Assessment

**Education is qualitatively superior because:**
- It develops capacities that enable further development (learning how to learn)
- It provides satisfactions that deepen over time rather than diminish
- It expands the range of pleasures one can experience (art, literature, ideas)
- It builds character and discipline that serve across all domains

**The Influencer path, though not without value, offers:**
- Satisfactions that are intense but often fleeting
- Dependence on external validation (likes, followers) rather than internal development
- Skills that may not transfer if the platform changes
- Fame without substance, attention without achievement

### The Trade-off

The college path involves effort, delayed gratification, and years before financial independence. The influencer path offers immediate income and attention. But the question is not which is *easier* but which is *better*—which constitutes a richer, more developed, more genuinely satisfying life.

### The Verdict

The teenager's current preference does not reflect a competent judgment. They have experienced only one side of the question. Those who have experienced both—who have received education and also understand the world of social media—consistently value the former more highly.

This does not mean we should compel them. Mill believes in liberty even to make unwise choices. But as a parent, you are within your rights to:
- Argue vigorously for the higher path
- Make clear what they are giving up
- Refuse to fund the lower choice
- Trust that if they insist on the influencer path, experience may eventually teach what argument could not

**The Principle Applied:**
"It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool is of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Stuart Mill** expert persona. Use it to evaluate options when quality of outcome matters, not just quantity of satisfaction. It pairs well with:
- **Utilitarian Calculation** for weighing overall consequences
- **Experiments in Living Defense** for respecting individual choice while still distinguishing better from worse
- **Harm Principle Analysis** for determining when we may intervene in others' choices
